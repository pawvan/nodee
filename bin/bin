### **7. Learn Authentication and Security**

Security is crucial when building web applications. Learn about:

- **Authentication**: Understand how to implement user authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or **OAuth**.
  
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and permissions.

- **Security Best Practices**:
  - Prevent **SQL injection**, **XSS** (cross-site scripting), and **CSRF** (cross-site request forgery).
  - Use **bcrypt** to hash and compare passwords.
  - Learn to use **helmet** to secure HTTP headers.
  - Understand **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and how to configure it.

---

### **8. Learn Testing & Debugging**

Testing and debugging are key skills for becoming a reliable developer.
